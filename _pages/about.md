I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Hailong Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n0NwuegAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. Xia Yin.  
I am broadly interested in combining tools from operations research, artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and algorithmic engineering to solve computational problems, especially applications in **electronic design automation**.
