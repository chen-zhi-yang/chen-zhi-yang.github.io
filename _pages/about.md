I am a Ph.D student from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Hailong Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n0NwuegAAAAJ&hl=en). I am broadly interested in combining tools from operations research, artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and algorithmic engineering to solve computational problems, especially applications in **electronic design automation**.
