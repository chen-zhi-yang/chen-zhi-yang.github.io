I am a Ph.D student from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Hailong Yao. I am broadly interested in combining tools from operations research, aritificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and algorithmic engineering to solve computational problems, especially applications in **electronic design automation**.
