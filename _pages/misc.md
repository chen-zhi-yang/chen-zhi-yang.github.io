I *was* a contestant of algorithmic competitive programming, and won silver medals in [National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI)](https://www.noi.cn) in high school. I always feel a sweet and melancholy nostalgia for NOI. It has paved my way to university, yet it also utterly transformed my heart and life. Nevertheless, those (never-coming-back) days spent discussing algorithmic problems with high school friends remain my most treasured memories, regardless of everything else.

I am a humble reader of modern literature and literary theory. A long (but not exhaustive) list of authors that I like: Roberto Bolaño, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Julio Cortázar, James Joyce, Anton Chekhov, Mishima Yukio, Walter Benjamin, and Roland Barthes. [Bolaño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bola%C3%B1o) is my personal favorite (though this does not mean he is the best). When I first read his short story collection, I realized (a bit sadly) that he is an author I will never be able to live without.

I am also interested in anime. I like Ikuhara Kunihiko (esp. Utena, the best anime ever), Tsurumaki Kazuya (esp. FLCL), Shinkai Makoto (except Suzume, the worst ever), Mizushima Tsutomu (Girls und Panzer, Shirobako, and Shuumatsu Torein Doko e Iku), Anno Hideaki (Evangelion and GunBuster), Kyoto Anime (esp. Hyouka and Hibike Euphonium), and almost all Sekai-kei / Nichijou-kei genres.
